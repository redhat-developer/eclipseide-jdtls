Let's make sure issue is not already fixed in snapshots first.

- [ ] I verified I can reproduce this issue against latest [snapshots build](https://github.com/redhat-developer/eclipseide-jdtls#-installation)

## Steps to reproduce

From a fresh installation and clean workspace:

* <steps to...>
* <...setup environment>

I tried

* <steps to...>
* <... trigger issue>

I expected: <what was the expected outcome?>

But got: <what is the actual undesired behavior?>

## Here is some relevant log output form (`<workspace>/.metadata/.log`)

## Community

- [ ] I understand reporting an issue to this OSS project does not mandate anyone to fix it. Other contributors may consider the issue, or not, at their own convenience. The most efficient way to get it fixed is that I fix it myself and contribute it back as a good quality patch to the project.
